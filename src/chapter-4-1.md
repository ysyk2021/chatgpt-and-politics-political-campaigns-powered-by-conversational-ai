What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
-------------------------------------

Artificial Intelligence refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI systems can analyze data, learn from patterns, make decisions, and interact with humans in a way that simulates intelligent behavior. Machine learning and natural language processing are common techniques used in AI to enable systems to understand and respond to human queries.

The Rise of Chatbots
--------------------

Chatbots are software applications designed to interact with users through conversation or text-based interfaces. They utilize AI technologies to understand user input, interpret it, and generate appropriate responses. Chatbots have become increasingly popular across various industries as they offer scalable, cost-effective, and round-the-clock customer support, information delivery, and personalized assistance.

Chatbots in Political Campaigns
-------------------------------

Political campaigns leverage Chatbots powered by AI systems to engage with voters effectively. By integrating Chatbots into campaign strategies, political organizations can reach a wider audience, provide real-time information, address concerns, gather feedback, and facilitate two-way communication. Chatbots enable personalized interactions at scale, making them invaluable tools for modern political campaigns.
