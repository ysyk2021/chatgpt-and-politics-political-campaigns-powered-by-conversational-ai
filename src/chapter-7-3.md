The use of ChatGPT powered by conversational AI is still in its early stages in political campaigns. However, it is expected to become more widespread in the coming years. As AI technology continues to improve, chatbots will become even more sophisticated, providing an opportunity for political campaigns to engage with voters on an even deeper level.

One potential application of ChatGPT in political campaigns is the use of voice-activated chatbots.
